# DE
This is an improved differential evolution (DE) algorithm, referred to as multiple-samples and mixed-strategy DE (msMS_DE).  In msMS_DE, multiple samples are used for fitness evaluation and a mixed strategy is employed for the mutation operation.

This algorithm is applied to various quantum control problems.
